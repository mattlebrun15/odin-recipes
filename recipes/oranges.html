        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh oranges (as many as needed)</li>
        <li>Optional: Sugar (for sweetening, if desired)</li>
        <li>Optional: Cinnamon or chili powder (for extra flavor)</li>
        <li>Optional: Fresh mint leaves (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Peel the oranges:</strong> Using your hands or a knife, peel the outer skin of the oranges, removing all the pith (the white part). This will leave you with just the juicy fruit segments.</li>
        <li><strong>Segment the oranges:</strong> Cut each orange into segments or "supreme" it by slicing between the membranes to get perfect, peel-free sections of orange.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional – Sweeten:</strong> If you'd like to make the oranges sweeter, sprinkle a little sugar over the top of the segments. You can also try a dusting of cinnamon or chili powder for a unique twist.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional – Garnish:</strong> Garnish with fresh mint leaves or other herbs for a fresh touch.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve immediately as a refreshing snack, or use the segments in fruit salads, smoothies, or desserts.</li>
    </ol>
